# Space Mario
Developed by Paul Farcasanu (2020). An infinite platformer written entirely in assmebly. 

## Getting Started
Download the source files on a Windows machine. If you're on Unix, look into [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page). The make file paths need to be edited to point to your MASM, as do the paths in game.asm.

Navigate to the project directory. Execute the following

`> make.bat`

`> game.exe`

## How to Play
Use the Up Arrow key to jump and land on platforms. You earn points as platforms and celestial objects scroll past. If you fall off the screen, you lose and can restart.
